# Instructions
Imagine a thief entering a house. In the house, there are infinitely many itemsthat can have only one of three different weights: 1 kg, 3 kgs, and 5 kgs. All of the items are discrete. The thief has a bag capacity of n kgs and strangely, he wants to steal the “smallest number of items”.You need to implement a mathematical recursive formulation for C(n) where C(n) denotes the smallest number of items the thiefcan steal using a bag capacity of n.

    (a) Implement a recursive algorithm that returns the smallest number of items the thief can steal using a bag capacity of n.

    (b) Implement a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the smallest number of items the thief can steal using a bag capacity of n.

    (c) Compare your results.
